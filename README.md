## Following Experiments have been done :

1. Implementation of Time Response of a System in MATLAB (Outputs in 1.pdf)
2. Study of Root Locus Plot using MATLAB (Outputs in 2.pdf)
3. Plotting Bode Plots through MATLAB (Outputs in 3.pdf)
4. Effect of variation of Kp , Kd and Ki of PID controller on system Parameters (Outputs in 4.pdf)
